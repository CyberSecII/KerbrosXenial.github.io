<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>A tool for setting up and hosting an apt repository using arbitrary
http/s hosts to make files accessible with extra features for git-enabled
hosting sites.
.
This tool, currently called apt-now but soon to be changed to repo-now, is
essentially a static site generator geared toward generating and formatting a
specific type of content in a specific type of way, the content being GNU/Linux
or Android/Linux binary packages, and the format being a signed repository
accessible from the web or something like  it  (It can also, for instance, be
used to statically host software  repositories over i2p with no substantial
modification.) It does this by taking  advantage of the structural regularity
of these types of resources and  constructs the whole site on the client side,
transmitting content to the  server only after a valid repository has been
built. This means that the server  doesn't have to run any code at all to
present the site to the end-user taking advantage of the resource over the web,
doesn't need to support ssh or remote desktop, and doesn't even technically
need to support ftp or git, as long as a way of transferring the repository to
the remote storage service can be included in the program.</p>
