.SS Details
.PP
This tool, currently called apt\-now but soon to be changed to
repo\-now, is essentially a static site generator geared toward
generating and formatting a specific type of content in a specific type
of way, the content being GNU/Linux or Android/Linux binary packages,
and the format being a signed repository accessible from the web or
something like it(It can also, for instance, be used to statically host
software repositories over i2p with no substantial modification.) It
does this by taking advantage of the structural regularity of these
types of resources and constructs the whole site on the client side,
transmitting content to the server only after a valid repository has
been built.
This means that the server doesn\[aq]t have to run any code at all to
present the site to the end\-user taking advantage of the resource over
the web, doesn\[aq]t need to support ssh or remote desktop, and
doesn\[aq]t even technically need to support ftp or git, as long as a
way of transferring the repository to the remote storage service can be
included in the program.
.SS Use Cases
.IP \[bu] 2
Personal Use: Independent, hobbyist, and self\-employed developers can
use this program to host their own packages in a way which allows them
to use their package management interface, encourages them to learn more
about their choices of software and GNU/Linux distributions, and which
provides an easy way for them to back up their configuration.
.IP \[bu] 2
Educational Use: Educational and corporate training programs which work
with Open\-Source projects can use this program to host code
repositories for employees during training, and in turn their trainers
and supervisors can follow versioned updates and use them to build
redistributable packages of viable projects.
.IP \[bu] 2
Activist Use: Activists who deliver things like privacy and security
related packages that might find their main repositories censored in
some regions can use this tool to maintain mirrors on sites which will
prove much more difficult to keep people from accessing, like "burner"
accounts on free file hosting sites, distributed file systems, and
fire\-and\-forget hidden services.
.IP \[bu] 2
Small Groups: Small groups of hobbyists and hackers can collaborate on
projects and take advantage of the instant clonability of github
repositories to create instant mirrors of their group\[aq]s packages,
sharing, testing, and growing their projects potential userbase and
lowering barriers to entry for their ideas.
.IP \[bu] 2
Small Businesses: Small businesses can save costs on hosting their
in\-house process software and encourage a culture of peer review by
hosting both their source repositories and tiny package repositories on
github, bitbucket, or similar versioned web hosting services.
.IP \[bu] 2
Large Businesses: Larger businesses which allow their employees to use
"20% time" or similar programs to develop projects can use this in
conjunction with tools like dh_make or fpm to roll out an instant
package repository when a program is ready for testing with a wider
audience.

.SS Versioning and Features
.PP
Right now, binary repository generation for Debian(APT Repositories) is
stable and source repository generation for Debian/Apt is nearing
stability and are in usuable form.
While these are the only working types of repositories, the
pre\-hyphenate part of this project\[aq]s name will be "apt."
Additionally, while an end user could use any means to transfer the
repository constructed by the apt\-now tool, there is currently only
support for the use of github\-pages as a hosting medium in the code.
While this remains the case the post\-hyphenate part of this
project\[aq]s name will be "git." When experimental support for F\-Droid
and Redhat(Yellowdog Updater) are complete, additional ways of
transferring the files will be considered and added, and the final
version will implement APT, YUM, and F\-Droid repositories in an easy to
configure, polyglot(But probably not agnostic) way.
.PP
You should be aware that if you use this, your .git directory will be
visible to all users of the repository, allowing them to completely copy
the repository and it\[aq]s entire history.
It assumes that is what you want.
If you don\[aq]t, you must remove the .git directory manually.
In the future, a command\-line option will be provided.

Binary Repository(Complete, Stable, Generates Web Pages from package

The documentation for fdroidserver sometimes implies that the system
requires some small amount of server\-side code.)

Binary Repository(Experimental, Still researching, but from the looks of
things it\[aq]s really straightforward.
I do not know how to build RPM packages though, so we\[aq]ll be working
with Fedora\[aq]s rpm\[aq]s.)
.IP \[bu] 2
Source Repository(Experimental, Still researching, but the YUM paradigm
seems to be astoundingly simple.)

.IP \[bu] 2
git(Complete as a way up updating the server, but can\[aq]t be used to
retrieve inpidual software packages or update software.
Cloning is pretty much like making an instant mirror, which is cool.)
Will be considered complete when a repository can be initialized and
cloned from in the apt\-now directory in the absence of a configured
web\-based git account.
.IP \[bu] 2
hg(Not started, but straightforward.
Pretty much the same as the git code with very little alteration, just
some transliterating of commands with identical benefits.) Will be
considered complete when fulfilling the same requirements as git.
.IP \[bu] 2
svn(Not started, but basically the same story for the purposes of this
system.) See above.
.RE

File Transfer Based

FTP(Not started, but really pretty easy, involves composing some
commands and configuring some usernames/passwords/keys/etc.)

SFTP(Not started, but basically maps onto ftp.
Probably like, one additional line of code and a teeny bit of planning
to support.)

bittorrent(Not started, probably will work with
apt\-p2p (http://www.camrdale.org/apt-p2p/) or
debtorrent (http://debtorrent.alioth.debian.org/) with minimal to no
modification.
Might have to generate some magnet links.
Probably going to conflict with Tor, but may be able to encourage use
within i2p?)

Self Hosting with local static httpd written in go.
Stupid easy to turn on, just build the web site with the \-l / \-\-serve
command line option or the START_HTTPD option in the config
file/environment variable.
.IP \[bu] 2
i2p eepsites are now also supported, and in fact this exact repository
is mirrored at fireaxe.i2p/apt\-now (http://fireaxe.i2p/apt-now), or
ov3ev5dplhdz6ipy442ftb4kzz4dembm3ifs2jo25qhiyw6f4ogq.b32.i2p/apt\-now (http://ov3ev5dplhdz6ipy442ftb4kzz4dembm3ifs2jo25qhiyw6f4ogq.b32.i2p/apt-now)
if you need the b32 address.
.IP \[bu] 2
Tor HS are now also supported and automatic, and they are also available
as a mirror at
hmuc3ffhrehwuenz.onion/apt\-now (http://hmuc3ffhrehwuenz.onion/apt-now)
to prove the concept.
If you\[aq]re only interested in making packages available to Tor users
and not your own anonymity, you can omit LOCAL_ONLY_HTTPD.
.RE
.SS Misc Features
.IP \[bu] 2
Output a site.
Collect information from within the packages, list them in
well\-formatted markdown files, and emit the markdown into html files
which link to eachother, also a sitemap.
This is all really easy to do on the client side.

.IP \[bu] 2
Break more functionality into smaller chunks.
Right now the generate function is huge and duplicates a pretty sizable
amount of code.
Write a generic function for building according to script, then existing
spec, then guessing.
This will make supporting more package types and more package building
tools and techniques easier.
